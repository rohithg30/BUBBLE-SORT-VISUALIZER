# BUBBLE-SORT-VISUALIZER
This project is an interactive visualization of the Bubble Sort algorithm implemented using Python and Pygame. Bubble Sort is a fundamental sorting algorithm with an average time complexity of O(n^2). The project aims to provide a dynamic and engaging way to understand how the algorithm works step by step.
